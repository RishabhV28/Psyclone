# Solution
- AI-Powered Virtual Patients: An interactive chatbot that simulates patients with various mental health disorders
- Realistic Conversational Flow: The AI mimics natural speech, emotional
responses, and symptom expression to replicate real-world patient interactions
- Customizable Scenarios: Students can select conditions (e.g., depression,
schizophrenia), patient backgrounds, and difficulty levels for tailored practice
sessions.
- Built-In Feedback System: After each session, the platform provides feedback
on student performance—highlighting empathy, missed cues, and diagnostic
accuracy

# How it works
- The student picks a mental health case (e.g., anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia) and
customizes patient details like age, gender, or background.
-  A large language model (LLM) simulates the patient’s responses—showing
symptoms, emotional tones, and behavioral cues based on the selected
condition
- The student engages in a mock clinical interview—asking open-ended
questions, observing cues, and trying to make a preliminary diagnosis
- Once the session ends, the platform analyzes the conversation and gives
feedback on missed red flags, empathy and communication, correctness of
diagnosis and suggested improvements
